# SecureDrive – Secure Password Manager

SecureDrive is a C++-based password management system that securely stores and manages user credentials using **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts and cybersecurity best practices. The project demonstrates how hash tables, linked lists, and file-based persistent storage can be applied to build a secure and efficient password manager.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication with hashed and salted passwords  
- **Password Update & History Tracking:** Prevent password reuse using linked lists  
- **File-Based Persistent Storage:** Simulates a secure database for credential persistence  
- **Password Security:** Strength enforcement, brute-force protection, and password rotation  
- **Extended Functionality:** Database export/import, hash table statistics, and scalable design

## DSA Concepts Used

- **Hash Tables:** Efficient username-password mapping and quick lookups  
- **Linked Lists:** Maintain password history for each user  
- **Separate Chaining:** Collision resolution in hash tables  
- **Rehashing:** Maintains performance as user base grows  
- **Stacks/Queues (Optional):** Undo operations or OTP handling

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Data Structures:** Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues  
- **Persistent Storage:** File-based database  
- **Security:** Hashing (SHA256 or custom), Salting, Password Strength Checks
